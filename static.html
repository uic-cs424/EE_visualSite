                <p> The visualization shows the pattern of the amount of crimes per year since the initial 
                    recording of the data. There is a legend on the side that matches a hue of blue to a year. 
                    There has always been crime as it shows that no year is skipped in the graph. If you hover 
                    over the slices of the pie chart, you can see the total count of crime per year and will 
                    notice that the amount of crime fluctuates over time; there was more crime counted in the 
                    early 2000s and began to lower after 2008. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis2"></div>
                <p> The visualization shows the total arrests made (per 10,000) per type of crime. More 
                    questions could arise from this visualization such as if there is a correlation between a 
                    type of crime and a number of arrests made. 
                    If you hover over the bars you can see the specific count of how many arrests were made. 
                    You can see that the highest amount of arrests is for narcotics and the lowest is for 
                    homicide. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis3"></div>
                <p> This visualization shows the amount of crime (per thousand) in each ward. This is a 
                    preview to a spatial visual where you could see specifically where in Chicago the wards 
                    are located, so it would be easier to understand where the wards are located. This is to see 
                    if there is more crime occurring in certain wards which could be used to compare where 
                    the arrests are being made to know if the crimes are being dealt with accordingly.
                    You can hover over the dots to see the specific amount of crime (per thousand) as well as 
                    the specific ward where the crime occurred. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis4"></div>
                <p> This visualization shows the count of crimes per month in the year of 2022. The main 
                    reason for the creation of this graph was to see if there was a time of year where crime 
                    occurs more. Initially it appears as if the amount of crime does not fluctuate a lot and 
                    stays around the same number throughout the year but upon closer inspection, you can 
                    see that there is more crime in the month of October and the lowest amount of crime is in 
                    February. An inference can be made that the holidays of October and February are a 
                    cause for their respective amount of crime. Another notable month is June and August, it 
                    could just be a coincidence or perhaps since the weather is warmer, it allows more crime 
                    to be done rather in the winter where the weather can get to a dangerous temperature. 
                    You can hover over the bars to see the specific amount of crime per month. </p>

                <p> A further inspection of the Crimes per month in 2022 is shown here as besides the total 
                    amount of crime per month, the specific type of crime per month is shown for each 
                    month throughout the year of 2022.  You can see that the main types of crimes are theft 
                    and battery. A legend is on the side of the visualization showing the mean of the amount 
                    of crimes. By showing the mean, you can see a more accurate visual of which crimes are 
                    committed most. You can hover over the boxes to see the month, the specific type of 
                    crime as well as the count of that crime. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis6"></div>
                <p> This visualization shows the linear change of crimes over time since the initial recording 
                    date of the data. Since there are so many types of crimes in the data, you see the top type 
                    of crime so the visualization is easier to comprehend. 

                    Something important to note is that the visualization gives the illusion that there was no 
                    crime in 2001, but that is because that was the year that the data started to be recorded. It 
                    could be that the data was recorded later in the year which would explain why the visual 
                    makes it seem as if there was no crime during that year.

                    This visual shows a more specific view of what the Crime per Year shows at the top of 
                    the page. This visualization further shows that there was more crime recorded in the early 
                    2000s as mentioned before and there is a consistent decline in the crime that's recorded, 
                    even if the data shows slight fluctuation. There is a notable change in 2020 that is most 
                    likely due to the lockdown. </p>
