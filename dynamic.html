                <p> This interactive visualization shows a similar story as the Change of Specific Crime Over 
                    the Years visualization on the Static Graphs page. Besides the general amount of crime, 
                    Domestic Crimes Over the Years also shows if the crime contains crimes that were 
                    domestic cases. The legend on the side is to show if the domestic case is true or false as 
                    that is how it is represented in the dataset. You can hover over the circle to see the total 
                    amount of crime recorded that year.
                    Crime Breakdown For the Year of undefined For undefined Cases shows the count of 
                    each type of crime for all years as the way that you can see a specific year would be by 
                    clicking on one of the circles from Change of Specific Crime Over the Years and then 
                    you will see that the title changes to the year and true or false, depending on what you 
                    click. You will see how the data changes based on the year of your choosing. The count 
                    of each type of crime will appear at the end of the bars. </p>

                <p> This visualization shows the top five crimes of each ward. The legend is on the side to 
                    see which symbol matches one of the crimes; you will notice that the legend has more 
                    than five crimes but not all wards have the same type of crime. If you click on a symbol 
                    on either of the graphs, the opposite graph will only show that symbol so you can see 
                    which wards have that crime as part of their top five crime list. If you hover over the 
                    symbol then you will see the count of that crime as well as type of crime. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis9"></div>
                <p> For these interactive visualizations, you can click on a box of the heatmap in order to see 
                    the count of that crime in that specific month; the title will change with the respective 
                    information. You have seen heat maps of how much crime has occurred over time in the 
                    Statics Graphs page but now you can see how much of that crime was reported 
                    throughout a year of your choosing. Use the scroll at the bottom of the visualization to 
                    choose a year to see if more crimes are reported or not over the years. You can also hover 
                    over the boxes to see the month, type of crime, and the count of that crime. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="visualization" id="vis10"></div>
                <p> Heatmap of the Number of Reported Crimes per Ward in A Range of Years shows how 
                    many reports were made, per ward, in a given range of years of your choosing. You can 
                    choose the year by using the sliding bars, so you can choose which year to start and 
                    which year to end. Additionally, you can choose a specific type of crime in the 
                    drop-down box. This visualization shows the patterns of number of arrests for a year and 
                    ward. For example, you can see that certain crimes were reported more in the early 2000s 
                    and were not reported as much in the later and more recent years. Yet other crimes such 
                    as assault remain mostly consistent since the initial recording date of the data.
                    The way that this visualization interacts with Location of the Ward Undefined is that 
                    when you click on a box of the heatmap, the respective ward will be highlighted in red on 
                    the map of Chicago. This allows for you to make the connection of what type of crime 
                    you are seeing with the specific location in Chicago. By now you have seen multiple 
                    visualizations of crimes with wards and now you can better visualize that information. </p>
