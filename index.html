                <br>An important note about this dataset is that it can be updated so the more recent data may not be as accurate because it can still be updated.<br>
                <br>

                <p>The dataset that is being used is from Chicago Data Portal of Chicago Crimes from 2001 to the present date.</p>
                <p>The dataset contains the types of crime, dates, location, ward number, if there was an arrest, if the crime was domestic abuse, etc. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These graphs are made to show patterns and answer some questions that arise from looking at the data such as if there is a correlation between the time of year</p> 
                <p>and the amount of crime. By each graph there will be a short description of each graph as well as a short, general description on the top of each page as the graphs </p>
                <p>are separated into static and dynamic graphs. The dynamic graphs are interactive so you will be able to see how the data changes over time or information of a specific type of crime.</p>
